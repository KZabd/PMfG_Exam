## RESULTS OF TASK 1
The task was to analyze the correlation between temperature and vegetation index (NDVI). The goal was to examine the relationship between the two variables using the data contained in the files “temp1”, “ndvi1”, “temp2” and “ndvi2”. The analysis involved a series of steps: displaying three images of the defined palettes, creating two histograms for each pair of data, and preparing a scatter plot showing the dependence of NDVI on temperature. The analysis had to be carried out in both Python and Matlab/Octave, which made it possible to compare the results obtained in both environments.

**Python**
In the code, I loaded data from TIFF files (temperature and NDVI) for two periods.Then, for each data set, I displayed the images (NDVI, temperature, difference), created histograms for temperature and NDVI, and made a scatter plot showing the relationship between NDVI and temperature.
